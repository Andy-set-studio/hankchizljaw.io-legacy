Congratulations. You’ve survived 3 or 4 years of University and you’ve got your piece of paper.

### What now?

This no-bullshit post is aimed at people with a design or web design orientated degree, wanting to get into a digital agency. I hope it helps manage your expectations and gives you an idea of what happens next.

### Your Skills Are Probably Outdated And Irrelevant

Sorry. It’s true.

There’s a good chance that the curriculum that you were learning is a good 3–5 years out of date. It’s not the end of the world though.

The important thing is that you will have learned some core skills while you were doing your degree. There’s also a good chance that you learned how to work in a team. You probably dealt with absolute knuckleheads too. This is a crucial skill.

### You Need To Level Up

Get learning. Do it now.

This industry moves at lightning speed. It’s crazy how much learning you need to do on a continuous basis. Get used to it though because it won’t change.

Keeping on top of your skills will only benefit you long-term. If you can look at work you did even a week ago and think: “man, that looks pretty shit” — you are on to a winner.

### You’re Both Over And Under Qualified

See what I did there?

There’s a damn good chance that you’ll be the only person in the agency with a degree. If not the only one. You’ll almost certainly be a minority.

If you think you are better than everyone else because you do have a degree, get off your high-horse and get your head down. Your piece of paper won’t be worth shit to your colleagues.

Also, don’t look at your payslip for the next 30 years. Student loan repayments are soul-crushing.

### You Will Be A Junior At Best

Suck it up.

Just because you have a degree, doesn’t mean you are going to waltz into an agency and be given the royal treatment. You need to earn your respect and reputation.

The work you did at University can probably be compared, in alcohol-terms as a can of Skol. Your colleagues are producing 50 year matured Scotch in comparison.

My advice is to learn from these folks like your life depends on it, because within a year of working with these folks, your ability will quadruple.

### Do Your Own Thing

Whether that’s building a personal blog or freelancing, just do it.

While you are looking for your first agency gig, freelance. This, above anything will show that you are willing to get yourself out there. You’ll also earn money which will help pay for those pesky student loan repayments.

The main plus about freelancing is that you’ll more than likely learn how to deal with difficult clients. This is such a crucial skill to master. You might never talk to clients in your real job, but you’ll probably have to explain in layman’s terms, a technical issue to an account manager. This will hopefully stop you having to build carousel after carousel in the long term*.

### Lighten Up And Enjoy Yourself

This industry is great and the people are even greater. Get stuck in, have a laugh and make some great stuff!
