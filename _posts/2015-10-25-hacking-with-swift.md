This is just a mini post for me to gush over how awesome the tutorial series, ‘Hacking With Swift’ is.

As mentioned in [my previous post](https://hankchizljaw.io/blog/time-to-learn-swift), I’m starting to learn Swift. I wanted to find a few decent tutorials to give me a little boost before I jumped into building one of my own ideas.

I stumbled across the ‘Hacking With Swift’ tutorial series after searching around for a while and instantly liked it. I like that it's structured like a curriculum and is built around 36 mini projects. This sort of structure and repetition is my ideal way to learn.

If like me, you are thinking about getting into Swift, then I strongly recommend that you [check out ‘Hacking With Swift’ here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com).
