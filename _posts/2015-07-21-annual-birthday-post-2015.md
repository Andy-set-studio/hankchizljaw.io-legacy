So I've decided that I want to write an annual post, to reflect on the 12 months since my last birthday.

This year I'm 28 years old. Ten years have passed since my 18th birthday. The time has flown much faster than I would have liked it to.

I spent some of yesterday (my actual birthday) thinking about the last 12 months and how it has turned out. I'm happy to say that it's been a mostly positive year.

### A Much Needed Job Change

I've spent a lot of my career working for agencies. Although this has provided me with some awesome opportunities, I found that I was becoming increasingly frustrated and burned out.

I think I now know what the main causes of my stress and unhappiness were in this period of my career. It was the people I worked for.

In every agency that I have worked for, I have struggled to agree with their attitude towards client work. I always felt that quality of delivery was a low priority. I know this is not the case for every agency. It just seemed to be the case at the places I was unfortunate enough to work for.

All this took it's toll on me, and in July 2014 and I decided enough was enough. This was probably the best decision that I made last year.

I now work for an amazing company within a product team, working on a product called [WriteUpp](http://writeupp.com). I also work remotely. This seems to have hugely improved my mental state too.

I find the change of pace and the focus on quality suites me to the ground. I finish work feeling good about myself and what I've achieved most days. When I finished a day in my previous jobs, I often felt frustrated and generally unhappy.

I'm really glad I decided to jump ship now.

### I Bought A New House

My Girlfriend and I have been wanting to buy a place of our own for a couple of years now. Although neither of us are local to the Gloucestershire area - we both wanted carry on living around here.

We finally found a house that we wanted to buy earlier this year, in a lovely part of the county called Winchcombe.

Compared to a few years ago, where I lived in the middle of a city - Winchcombe is out in the sticks by comparison. It'll be interesting to see how our quality of life changes in this environment.

### That's It For Now

2014 into 2015 has been pretty quiet. Some really positive changes have happened and I think my time as a 27 year old was pretty good.

Let's hope for another pretty decent year :)
