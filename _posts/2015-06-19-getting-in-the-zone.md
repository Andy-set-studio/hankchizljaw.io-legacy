It's the hardest thing to do as a designer.

I really struggle to get in the zone. I'm pretty sure I would find running a marathon easier sometimes. When you work in an agency though, sometimes you just have to get in the zone - there and then.

###But How Can You Possibly Do That?

It's really hard and it takes years to condition yourself to be able to do it. The answer for me personally, is as simple as one word.

> Procrastination.

I hear the sound of a thousand cups of ‘aeropressed' coffee being spat out as I write this.

There's a whole tech micro-economy of apps and services that stop us procrastinating and make us ‘more productive'. I think my method is equally as productive though.

My theory is simple. Productivity is measured in a plethora of ways. In design terms, for me, quality is the right measurable.

I could easily force myself to sit in front of Photoshop or Sketch and put any old shit together to meet a requirement of quantitative productivity. I would hate the work I produced though. In former agency jobs, this is exactly what had to be done.

I much prefer to spend an hour procrastinating and ‘warming' my creative brain up. I then produce an arguably much higher standard of work, in a shorter amount of time. I tend to like the work I produce with this method.

###So What Do I Do?

I do a variety of things that put me in the right mood to design. A typical list for me would be:

- Reading articles
- Wrestling the cat that still thinks she is a kitten
- Having a one way conversation with the other cat that spends all day asleep
- Playing pool on my iPhone
- Reddit

All of the above tend to put me in a good mood. When I'm in a good mood, I tend to be at my most creative.

A lot of people claim that doing some exercise or other ‘Twitter approved' activities make them feel creative.

I just like pissing around until my brain says “it's design time, Andy”.
