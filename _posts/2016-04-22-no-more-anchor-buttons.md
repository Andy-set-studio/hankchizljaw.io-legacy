I've been as guilty as the next person for using `<a>` tags as buttons in the past and it's something that from today onwards, won't happen again.

An `<a>` tag is for linking to other pages of a website. It's not for triggering some fancy JavaScript interaction. An `<a>` tag is however much easier to style than a `<button>`, which makes the wide usage of them as buttons understandable.

You might wonder why this sudden realisation has occurred now. It should have occurred a long time ago, but today I logged into [Nest](http://www.nestpensions.org.uk/), the workplace pension provider's *"My Account"* area.

This tweet followed shortly after:

I couldn't navigate around the application using Google Chrome on Mac OS X. Seemingly every `<a>` tag had been hijacked by JavaScript. Said JavaScript didn't seem to be working.

I immediately thought of all the occasions that I have attached a JavaScript event to an `<a>` tag and I suddenly fealt unbearably guilty that someone might have used one of these UIs without JavaScript available to them.

From this day forward, I will not use an `<a>` for a JavaScript event ever again unless I absolutely have to. I'll be using a `<button>` where possible and visually-hiding it where JavaScript isn't available. Hopefully I won't be responsible for anyone's frustration while using a UI I built again.

You have my word.
