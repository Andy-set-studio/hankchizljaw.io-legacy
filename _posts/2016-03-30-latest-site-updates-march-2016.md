Just a quick post about a change of hosting provider.

I used [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com) religiously for a couple of years and thoroughly enjoyed the service. I have however found maintaining my own unmanaged VPS difficult, as it's not what I'm good at whatsoever.

With the introduction of Kirby CMS on this site and its flat-file architecture, I was running into all sorts of gremlins that I just couldn't fix myself.

This is mainly why I've decided to give [Media Temple](http://bit.ly/1pVaRwB) another crack.

Media Temple's support so far has been incredible and I've found integrating my [DeployBot](http://deploybot.com/) repos an absolute breeze.

That's it for now. Let's hope that this new relationship with Media Temple will be as nice as their UI!
