title: "Should A Designer Be Able To Code?"
summary: "I talk about my opinion on wether or not designers - specifically web designers should be able to code. If they can't code to a production level, I argue that they should at-least be able to code basic HTML and CSS."

### Probably.

In my opinion, a designer should have a broad understanding of the medium they are designing for. If they are print designers, they should understand stock and print methods. If they are an interior designer, they should understand light and space. You get the idea.

As with most things in the web community, this conversation seems to be getting out of hand. I thought I'd add my two pence to the mix and talk specifically about website design.

### We're not talking about production code

Yes that's exactly what we're not doing. A front-end developer is a specialist in at-least HTML and CSS. They're probably pretty hot at JavaScript too. A back-end developer is a specialist in server-side technology, object oriented programming and so-on. I'm not suggesting a designer works at these levels.

A designer *should* really be able to code basic HTML and CSS at a minimum. They need to understand the medium that they are working in and having basic coding skills, will only ever help with this. This will help them show some empathy towards their developer companions too.

### Surely a developer should be able to design then?

Possibly.

I'm not suggesting that developers should pick up a copy of Sketch and produce pixel-perfect designs. I do however think that both front-end and back-end developers should at least understand what a designer does and the benefit that they bring to the table. Empathy from both directions is always going to help isn't it?

### Final thoughts

To be honest, I think we should stop talking about this now. We should use that energy to produce awesome work as teams. You never know, you might make something truly stunning if you give your colleagues a bit more empathy.
