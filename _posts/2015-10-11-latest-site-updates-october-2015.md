I’ve been guilty of abandoning my site over the last couple of months, so I decided to give it a bit of love. I'm also determined to make regular iterations as mentioned in my [post about the redesign](https://hankchizljaw.io/blog/site-redesign-2015).

### The change log

The first update was a necessary update as my SSL certificate was due to expire. I use [StartSSL’s](https://www.startssl.com) service for this as it’s fairly simple and pain-free to use. Because my site is on a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com) droplet, I followed [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-apache-with-a-free-signed-ssl-certificate-on-a-vps) to implement the new SSL.

The second update was to replace the old front-end framework with [this newer one](https://github.com/4ndeh/Front-End-Base-Project) that I've recently put together. This should make my site a little easier to maintain down the line with a much less fragmented toolset than I had previously used.

The third update I made was some accessibility improvements. The site was actually fairly well built in that sense, so there wasn't too much more to add. I added some more aria attributes to certain elements and added a shortcut link to the main content from the header. I've been getting really into accessibility in my day job at [WriteUpp](http://www.writeupp.com) recently, so it was good to implement some of my learning to my own site.

Lastly, I have removed the theme system and changed the colour scheme to something a little more neutral. I've also replaced the sky blue highlight with a deep orange tone instead. I’m hoping this provides some more contrast with links and highlights.

### That’s all for now

I’ve got plans for further updates down the line which should hopefully allow me to create some more engaging content. For now, these updates should keep me happy for a while :)
