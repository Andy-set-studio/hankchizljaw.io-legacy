Today is [CSS Tricks' 10th Birthday](https://css-tricks.com/the-tenth-fourth/), so I thought I'd reminisce on my early days and how much the website has helped me out since then. 

I [picked up web design as a hobby](https://hankchizljaw.io/about/) just before CSS tricks was born. The website didn't catch my attention until around 2009 when I was blagging my way through my early freelance career. From being a `<table>` and ActionScript wizard, I suddenly needed to learn CSS and WordPress to fulfill a client brief that I stupidly agreed to.

With the sudden need to up-skill, I found [Digging In To WordPress](https://digwp.com/) and [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) which were absolute gold. Using the sites to learn and reference, I managed to scrape through the project and push myself into the modern web-stack. 

The rest is history. 

CSS Tricks has continued to be a major resource for me. It inspires me daily and provides the most incredibly useful [almanac](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/) of CSS selectors and properties, which I reference religiously. 

So, thank you [Chris](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier) and [the team](https://css-tricks.com/about/). You continue to consistently produce incredible content that has surely shaped a generation of web designers and developers. 

I look forward to seeing what the next 10 years of CSS Tricks will bring!
