I’ve been threatening to learn Swift since it was announced at WWDC14 and I’ve always fancied producing a truly native iOS app. With the announcement of Apple TV with tvOS and 3D touch recently, I don’t want to put it off any longer.

I’ve already tried to work on a native app in the past

I investigated native app development in a previous job, back in 2012. I tried to build a very basic, audio / visual catalogue app with various approaches such as objective-c, Flash and Phonegap (Cordova).

I ditched objective-c because I found the language incredibly difficult to get along with. Flash was a lazy approach because I was already working with ActionScript a lot. I finally settled with Phonegap as it was very accessible and well documented.

Recently at WriteUpp, we have released the WriteUpp mobile platform on iOS and Android, using Cordova. The technology worked very well for that project, mainly because our team's combined skill-set is very much web orientated. The other key reason to this technology choice is that we wanted to support both iOS and Android with a shared codebase.

Even with this in mind, I still want to learn Swift.

I haven’t spent any time properly learning anything for quite a while now and I really miss it. I could spend time honing my JavaScript skills by picking up one of the endless fashionable frameworks that have appeared. That doesn’t appeal to me though. I really like the idea of trying the seamless design and dev process of the native iOS workflow.

So what am I going to make?

I am not 100% sure yet. I want to build something useful that I can go to town on the design aspect. Inspired by Tapbots and their excellent work with Tweetbot, I wanted to tackle a 3rd party Facebook client. Unfortunately, they appear to be reducing the ability to access a user’s "home feed" which will make things too difficult - especially for a n00b like myself.

There are a couple of ideas swimming around, so I suppose I will have a play to see which one sticks. Part of the early learning process will be to prototype an idea or two before I even think about opening Sketch. I’ll probably also put the code on my Github account so you can keep an eye on how it’s going.

For now, that is all. I’ll keep you posted.
