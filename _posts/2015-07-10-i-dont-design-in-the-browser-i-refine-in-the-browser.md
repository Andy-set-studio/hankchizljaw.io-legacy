It’s quite trendy these days for a designer or developer to proudly announce that they design in the browser. I’ve personally never found this approach has ever helped me to achieve a good standard of design.

### Call Me Old Hat If You Will

I get off on playing with a look and feel in software such as Sketch or Photoshop. My brain is in design mode, therefore I want to use a tool that helps me express my creativity.

When I am writing code, my brain is not in design mode, it is in dev mode. Instead of thinking about colour, type and form - I’m thinking about modularity, accessibility and responsiveness. I find mixing the two brain modes together to be very difficult. To be honest, I don’t think I'll ever want to mix those two brain modes together.

### My Approach Is More Circular

As I’ve mentioned before, I like to work on designs in Sketch or Photoshop. I generally favour Sketch these days, so I’ll use that for this example. Let’s skip the wireframe process too for shortness sake.

When I start the visual design process, I’ll open Sketch and set up around three artboards. I’ll set up a large viewport, a medium viewport and a small viewport. These will tend to be desktop, tablet and mobile.

I’ll then go through the process of working through some typography work, some colour work and the overall look and feel. I also do this process desktop down*. Shoot me.

When I’ve got a look and feel that both I and the project stakeholder are happy with, I move on to working with some HTML and CSS. I’ll build out some templates that match the look and feel. I do this bit mobile up. Thumbs up to that.

It’s around this time that I might start thinking that something isn’t really working. Sometimes I’ll play around with the problem in code. A lot of the time, I often find that solving the problem at this level results in a fairly ugly resolution. I prefer to open up Sketch and work it out there. I suppose it helps to be a [designer who can code](https://hankchizljaw.io/blog/should-a-designer-be-able-to-code) with this workflow.

I’ll just repeat and refine this process until we’re all happy.

### Conclusion

This is my approach and it’s how I’ll continue to work until I find a better one. I’m not saying that designing in the browser is stupid, I’m just offering an alternative view on that approach.

My advice as always is to do whatever makes you achieve the best that you can achieve. Don’t feel that you have to blindly follow the trends. Not all the time anyway.
