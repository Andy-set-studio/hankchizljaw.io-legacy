I'm currently:

- Maintaining [Stalfos](https://stalfos.io) - the lightweight, skeletal front-end base project
- Improving my JavaScript knowledge by learning React and Express JS. Check out my playground project, [Procon](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/procon)
- Focusing heavily on improving accessibility with my design and front-end development work

Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff)' excellent idea.
