I started designing and building websites as a hobby in 2006 with a trusty copy of ‘Dreamweaver 8 Design and Construction’. My interest levels really peaked when I discovered that you could modify the look and feel of your MySpace page and build free GeoCities sites.

In my years of working in this industry I have been lucky enough to work with great brands such as Harley-Davidson®, Sky, British Cycling, the NHS and Oracle. Working with these organisations has allowed me to produce design systems at scale.

You can see what I'm currently doing on my [now page](/now).

If you would like to get in touch, ping me an email.
