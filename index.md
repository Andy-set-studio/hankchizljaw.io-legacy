I'm obsessed with producing lightweight, accessible and functional websites that put the user first. I focus heavily on component based design systems powered by BEM driven CSS and modern JavaScript such as ES6, Node, React and Vue.

I build cool products at [No Divide](//nodividestudio.com) by day and work on [helpful projects](//github.com/hankchizljaw) in my free time.
